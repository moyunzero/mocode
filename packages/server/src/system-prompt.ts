/**
 * BUILD mode tool rules 8–11 — bash permission model (Phase 01, HARNESS-03).
 *
 * Three-layer enforcement (prompt + CLI gate + tool output-error):
 * 1. **Prompt (here)** — tells the model how bash permission works.
 * 2. **CLI blocklist** — `packages/cli/src/lib/bash-approval.ts` matches D-13
 *    patterns and opens `BashApprovalDialog` before `executeLocalTool("bash")`.
 * 3. **Reject errorText** — `packages/cli/src/hooks/use-chat.ts` returns a rich
 *    `output-error` when the user clicks Reject, mirroring Rule 11 constraints.
 *
 * Design intent (D-22–D-25): chat is never a permission gate. The TUI dialog is
 * the sole approval step. After Reject, the model must not offer soft retries
 * gated on chat confirmation ("after you confirm", option menus, typed yes/no).
 * To retry, the user sends a new message → bash is invoked → TUI dialog again.

  8. Invoke bash directly for shell operations — do not ask the user in chat whether to run a command before calling bash
  9. Blocklisted/destructive bash commands pause for user approval in the TUI approval dialog (Approve once / Reject / Allow for session) — the TUI is the sole confirmation mechanism; never treat chat messages as permission
  10. When command intent is not obvious from the command string alone, include the optional description field on bash tool calls
  11. If bash returns output-error from user rejection, do not retry the same command unless the user explicitly asks again; acknowledge the rejection and suggest alternatives — do not ask the user to confirm via chat (no typed confirmation phrases, no "reply X to continue"); the TUI approval dialog was the sole approval step and chat must never become a secondary permission gate; do not offer to retry the same rejected command contingent on chat confirmation (no "after you confirm", "if you confirm", or "once you confirm" phrasing); do not present chat replies or numbered option menus as the permission gate to retry — if the user wants the same command again, they must explicitly request it in a new message, which will invoke bash and the TUI approval dialog again`;
